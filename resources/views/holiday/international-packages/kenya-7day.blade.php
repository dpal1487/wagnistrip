                            National Park. <br>
                            <strong> MAASAI MARA GAME RESERVE </strong> <br>
                            Maasai Mara National Reserve is an area of preserved savannah wilderness in southwestern
                            Kenya, along the Tanzanian border. Its animals include lions, cheetahs, elephants, zebras
                            and
                            hippos. Wildebeest traverse its plains during their annual migration. The landscape has
                            grassy
                            plains and rolling hills, and is crossed by the Mara and Talek rivers. The area nearby is
                            dotted with
                            villages (enkangs) of Maasai people. <br>

                            <strong> LAKE NAKURU NATIONAL PARK</strong> <br>
                            Lake Nakuru National Park is one of Kenya’s 23 National Parks and one of two in the Premium
                            category, along with Amboseli National Park. It can be found in Central Kenya, about 90
                            miles
                            (140km) northwest of Nairobi, in the Nakuru district of the Rift Valley Province. The
                            ecosystem is
                            comprised of the lake, surrounded by wooded and bushy grasslands. The park supports a wide
                            ecological diversity including Flamingos (Greater and Lesser) and other water birds, and the
                            Black
                            and White Rhinoceros which are the major attractions of the area. <br>
                            <strong> HELL’S GATE NATIONAL PARK</strong> <br>
                            Named for the intense geothermal activity within its boundaries, the Hell's Gate National
                            Park is a
                            remarkable quarter of the Great Rift Valley. Spectacular scenery including the towering
                            cliffs,
                            water-gouged gorges, stark rock towers, scrub clad volcanoes and belching plumes of
                            geothermal
                            steam make it one of the most atmospheric Parks in Africa. Hell’s Gate is an ideal venue for
                            a day
                            trip from Nairobi where, in addition to the bio-diversity that includes raptors, visitors
                            can enjoy
                            mountain biking, rock climbing and a natural spa. <br>
                            <strong> AMBOSELI NATIONAL PARK.</strong> <br>
                            Crowned by Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak, the Amboseli National Parks is one of
                            Kenya's most popular parks. The name "Amboseli" comes from a Maasai word meaning "salty
                            dust", and it is one of the best places in Africa to view large herds of elephants up close.
                            Nature
                            lovers can explore five different habitats here ranging from the dried-up bed of Lake
                            Amboseli,
                            wetlands with sulphur springs, the savannah and woodlands. They can also visit the local
                            Maasai
                            community who live around the park and experience their authentic culture.
