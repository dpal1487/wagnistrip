                                                        border. How is that possible? It is simple, we are going to take
                                                        you to the unrecognized country

                                                        the last soviet country. We are going to

                                                        see, that Bender is just a smaller
                                                        version of Chisinau. Next destination – is the capital,
                                                        Tiraspol. Its main street is full by imperial

                                                        the monuments of Lenin. If you are
