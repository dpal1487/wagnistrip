                                        Start this epic road trip journeying along the ever-changing scenery on your first day’s drive from
                                        Cape Town to the Southern Cape. Wind your way through mountain passes where lazy baboons

                                        Get ready for the famous Route 62, modeled after America’s Route 66, but with a distinctly local
                                        flavour and the longest wine route in the world. The Route 62 is more than just a leisurely drive –
                                        showcasing local culture, food, larger-than-life local characters and world-class wines. Wine lovers
                                        will be in their element with a Wine Tasting pit stop to sample some of the local produce about
                                        midway to your overnight stop. Few things are more beautiful to behold than the innate majestic
                                        beauty of this Valley of Wine with a glass of wine in hand. <br>
                                        Complete the day with a journey through the landscape of rugged plains and towering cliffs to reach
                                        Oudtshoorn, the ostrich capital of the world, situated in the semi-desert Klein Karoo. Those seeking
                                        a close encounter with Mother Nature can join rangers on an optional Elephant Educational Bush
                                        Walk at the Buffelsdrift private game reserve. Follow these three rescued elephants; Jabari,
                                        Malaika and Bulelo, as they walk to the waterhole. These gentle giants were orphaned when their
                                        parents were poached in the north of South Africa. In efforts to keep the family together, they were
                                        transferred to Buffelsdrift, bringing their boisterous personalities with them. You are free to take
                                        pictures from a distance and can ask the rangers as many questions as you wish as you walk in
                                        their massive footsteps. <br>
                                        You’ll spend the evening here at leisure in this countryside town of Oudtshoorn. Either ask your
                                        guide to help you book a restaurant or taste local delights, such as ostrich "sosaties" (kebabs) and
                                        "pot brood" (bread cooked on open flames) at an optional 'braai' (bbq) experience and spend the
                                        evening around a crackling fire under the vast twinkling starry country sky.

                                    bird-filled paddocks and farms lining the highway or the colourful feather stalls on the way to town
                                    centre, you will from the many show farm signs and the palatial sandstone homesteads that hark
                                    back to an era when ostrich feathers were worth more than gold. The Cango Ostrich Show Farm
                                    gives you a glimpse into the farming industry, allowing you to observe the world’s biggest bird beakto-beak and test the toughness of the shells. Ostrich steak or kebabs complete the experience for
                                    those with an adventurous appetite.
                                    Head to the mountains to delve deep underground to the magical Cango Caves’ limestone
                                    chambers, alive with drip formation stalactites and stalagmites and remnants of Khoikhoi paintings.

                                    allows would-be contortionists to squeeze, twist and wiggle their way through limestone chimneys
                                    on a rather more adventurous underground route.

                                    Venture along the N2 national road as you return to the Cape and stop at a seaside village called
                                    Mossel Bay. Choose between another optional Botlierskop 4x4 Safari drive at this nearby private
                                    game reserve or visit Mossel Bay’s Diaz Beach after a leisurely walk to the Cape St Blaize trail to
                                    the lighthouse.
                                    After all the excitement of the week; ticking off the region's bucket list items and exploring the best
                                    spots of the Garden Route and beyond, you'll say your goodbyes as you reach Cape Town or
                                    Stellenbosch. End with an evening drop-off at your Cape Town or Stellenbosch accommodation in
                                    evening about 8pm to 10pm, subject to traffic and your drop-off address.
                                    > Please do not make any scheduled arrangements (especially flights) for the first or last day of
                                    the tour, as traffic and weather can delay the approximate pick-up and drop-off times on group
                                    tours.
