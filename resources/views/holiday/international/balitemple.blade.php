        shrines on the south-western slopes of Mount Agung. At least 70 celebrations take place at Besakih every year,
        as each shrine has its own anniversary. Besakih is considered to be the biggest and holiest of Bali’s temples.
        Its high location offers spectacular countryside views with rice paddies, hills, mountains, and streams.
