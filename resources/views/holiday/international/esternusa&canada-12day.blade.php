                                        morning, we immediately make our way from New York to Boston. Along the way we stop in
                                        Newport, Rhode Island, with some free time to explore and grab lunch. This beautiful seaside town
                                        has a rich history. It was founded in 1639 and became an important port in the colonial era. Since
                                        then it has transformed into a bustling artists' community and popular holiday destination. It is also
                                        home to the US Naval War College. Leaving Newport behind, we'll cruise through Connecticut to
                                        Boston. After settling in at our hotel, your Expat Explore tour leader will take you on a driving tour.
                                        We'll see a few of Bostonâ€™s highlights, including Quincy Hall and the cityâ€™s oldest park.r

                                    Flume Gorge in New Hampshire. This natural gorge extends for 800 feet at the base of Mount
                                    Liberty, and the sheer walls narrow to 12 feet apart in places. With a boardwalk taking you deep
                                    into the gorge, this is a priceless photo opportunity! Next, we cross into Canada and head straight
                                    for Quebec City, the country's only walled settlement. Once we've freshened up at the hotel, we hit
