                        We are back from our wonderful trip and all thanks to you MTT. Planning and bookings were
                        well
                        done as expected. Your set itinerary made the best use of our time. The hotels and tours were
                        very
                        comfortable, I had a fantastic experience with both my Greece and Turkey trip. In Greece I was
                        in
                        Athens
                        and Santorini ( the hotel in Santorini is one the best I have ever stayed). Our travel partner
                        was
                        Mercury Travel and Grace Solomon was the person to go'. especially with kids. Even with
                        compressed
                        timelines, we thought that we saw the best of both countries. We had an issue with day 1 Tour
                        guide
                        and it was taken care the next day.

                        As always, MTT has delivered a truly wonderful travel experience for us. Norway was a
                        great
                        travel destination. The parts of the country we visited were beautiful, people were
                        friendly, everything
                        we ate was delicious, and there were many fun things to see and do. The hotels we stayed
                        at in Oslo,
                        Svolvar and Tromso were all great and each excursion we took was memorable and fun.

                        I take this pleasure to thank MTT for a wonderful & unforgettable trip to
                        London. Thanks for all the
                        love and care you had expressed to each of us specially "My Birthday
                        celebration" :-) I was impressed at
                        the every moment that we had interacted with your team before and during the
                        trip.

                        We all can not thank you enough for an excellent trip you organized for us to
                        The
                        Andaman & Nicobar
                        Islands. Thanks to your meticulous planning everything was fantastic and we
                        had
                        no issue whatsoever.
