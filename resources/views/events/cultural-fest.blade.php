                        or values. These events aim to spread and disseminate cultural themes. These can refer to different
                        arts such as performing arts, musicals, photography, literature,â€¦.Festivals or conferences are
                        usually organized on a particular theme. Each type of event requires a physical space adapted to its
                        characteristics, a certain technical achievement, a certain transmission strategy. These events are
                        usually organized by societies or cultural groups. However, in the cultural events sector we can
                        also find companies specializing in promotional marketing.</p>
